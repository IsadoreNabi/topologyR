\title{Create a topology with completely disconnected sets}
\usage{
simplest_topology(datos)
}
\arguments{
\item{datos}{Numeric vector containing the data points to analyze}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item R - A list of relationships between vertices
\item subbase - Sets of individual vertices
\item base - Singleton sets
\item topology - Completely disconnected topology of singleton sets
}
}
\description{
This function generates a topology where each set in the topology
is a singleton (contains only one element), resulting in a completely
disconnected topological structure. Each vertex exists in isolation,
with no meaningful connections between sets.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The subbase contains individual elements
\item The base consists of singleton sets
\item The topology is formed by these singleton sets
\item No meaningful topological relationships are established between elements
}
}
\examples{
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
