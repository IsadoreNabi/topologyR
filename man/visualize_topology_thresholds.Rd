\title{Visualize and Compare Different Threshold Methods}
\usage{
visualize_topology_thresholds(data, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector to analyze}

\item{plot}{Logical indicating whether to display plots (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the following columns:
\itemize{
\item method: The name of the threshold calculation method
\item threshold: The calculated threshold value
\item base_size: The size of the resulting topological base
}
}
\description{
This function creates a comprehensive visualization of different
threshold methods used in topology analysis. It generates three distinct plots
to help understand the relationships between different threshold methods and
their effects on topological structure:
\enumerate{
\item A comparison of threshold values across methods, showing how different
calculation approaches affect the threshold magnitude
\item A comparison of base sizes for each method, illustrating how different
thresholds influence the complexity of the resulting topology
\item A scatter plot revealing the relationship between thresholds and base sizes,
helping identify potential optimal threshold values
