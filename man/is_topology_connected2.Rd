\title{Check if a topology is connected using directed graph approach}
\usage{
is_topology_connected2(topology)
}
\arguments{
\item{topology}{A list of sets representing the topology}
}
\value{
\code{logical} scalar. Returns \code{TRUE} if the topology is
connected through directed graph traversal (considering sequential
connections between elements), \code{FALSE} otherwise. Returns
\code{FALSE} if the topology is empty.
