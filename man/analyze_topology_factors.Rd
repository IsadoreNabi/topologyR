\title{Calculate topology characteristics for different IQR factors}
\usage{
analyze_topology_factors(data, factors = NULL, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector containing the data to analyze}

\item{factors}{Numeric vector of factors to test (default: c(1, 2, 4, 8, 16))}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the following columns for each factor:
\itemize{
\item factor: The IQR division factor used
\item threshold: The calculated threshold (IQR/factor)
\item base_size: Number of sets in the topological base
\item max_set_size: Size of the largest set
\item min_set_size: Size of the smallest set
}
}
\description{
This function analyzes how different IQR (Interquartile Range) factors affect
the topology's characteristics. It helps users determine the optimal factor
for their specific data by showing how the factor choice impacts the base size
and set sizes in the resulting topology.
}
\details{
The function works by:
\enumerate{
\item Calculating different thresholds using IQR/factor
\item Creating a subbase using these thresholds
\item Generating the base from intersections of subbase elements
\item Analyzing the resulting topology's characteristics
}

A larger factor results in a smaller threshold, which typically leads to
a finer topology with more distinct sets but smaller set sizes.

\examples{
# Generate sample data
data <- rnorm(100)

# Analyze topology with default factors
results <- analyze_topology_factors(data)
print(results)

# Use custom factors
custom_results <- analyze_topology_factors(data, factors = c(2, 4, 6))
print(custom_results)
